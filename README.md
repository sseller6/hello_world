# Overview

As an aspiring software engineer, I've created this repository to show future employers the effort I've put into learning how to program.

# Software Description

The purpose of this software is to display a simple message, "Hello, World!" to the console.

My intention with developing this software is to provide evidence that I know and understand how to use Python.

Below is a link to video demonstrating that the software works.
